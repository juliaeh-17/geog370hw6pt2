    <h1 style="color:darkorchid">Homework 6, Part 2: Census Data Ratios and Categories</h1>
    <p>Note: My dataset for part 2 was different than part 1, because for part 1, I used median family income. Since it was already a median, this data could not be normalized. For part 2, I used data on households that receive public assistance income or SNAP benefits in Illinois. The ratio used for all of the maps was number of households that received public assistance income or SNAP divided by number of households in the county. I then multiplied that by 100 to find the percentage.</p>

    <h2 style="color:cadetblue">Equal Interval Map</h2>

        <img src="./maps/equal_interval_IL.png" alt="equal interval" width="500 px"></a>
    <p>Because the data was able to be represented as a percentage, the equal interval category depicted the data fairly well. It made the categories easy to follow, as they were split up into intervals of four, starting at 5%, with the last group being any county with more than 21%. I think it was interesting to compare this map with my map and data from part 1, because the counties that had the lowest median income typically had the highest percentage of households that received public assistance income or SNAP. For my dataset, I did not see many cons to using this category due to the fact that the intervals were fairly small, so all categories were shown on the map.</p>

    <h2 style="color:darkcyan">Natural Breaks Map</h2>

        <img src="./maps/natural_breaks_IL.png" alt="natural breaks" width="500 px">
    </a>
    <p>For this dataset, I do not think the natural breaks depicted the map as well as the equal interval category. While it wasn't all that different, I think the fact that some of the categories had such a small interval (a range of 3%), it made the map harder to comprehend certain patterns. Perhaps, for that reason, I should have made fewer categories.</p>

    <h2 style="color:darkslategray">Quantile Map</h2>
    <a href="./maps/quantile_IL.png">
        <img src="./maps/quantile_IL.png" alt="quantile" width="500 px">
    </a>
    <p>For this datset, I believe the quantile map could be misleading in some ways. For example, because the last category included all counties with > 17%, it had the greatest interval of all the categories, and therefore showed more counties within that range than the other maps. However, I think it was beneficial to show the first category (5-10%) using that range, because in comparison with the median income map, it definitely reflected which counties had the highest median income within Illinois. Furthermore, I think it was interesting to see the darkest counties directly next to the lighest counties, showing a disparity between income and poverty levels, even with counties that are side by side.</p>
